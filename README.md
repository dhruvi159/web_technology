# Resume Project Using HTML Frames

This project is a personal resume website built with HTML frames. All source files are located in the [`attachments`](attachments) folder.

## Features

- **Multi-section Resume:** The resume is divided into sections such as About, Academic, Education, Experience, Hobby, and Skills.
- **Navigation Frame:** The site uses a navigation frame for easy access to different sections.
- **Main Content Frame:** Each section is displayed in the main frame for a seamless browsing experience.
- **Custom Styling:** The site uses a dedicated CSS file (`style.css`) for consistent and attractive styling.

## File Structure

- `main_frame.html`: Main layout using HTML frames.
- `navigation_frame.html`: Navigation menu for switching between resume sections.
- `about.html`, `academic.html`, `edu.html`, `Experience.html`, `hobby.html`, `skills.html`: Individual resume sections.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the website.

## How It Works

1. Open `main_frame.html` in your browser.
2. The left frame displays the navigation menu (`navigation_frame.html`).
3. The right frame displays the selected resume section.
4. All content is styled using `style.css`.

## Usage

To view the resume, simply open [`main_frame.html`](attachments/main_frame.html) in any web browser.

## Customization

- Update the HTML files in the [`attachments`](attachments) folder to modify your resume content.
- Edit `style.css` to change the appearance.
